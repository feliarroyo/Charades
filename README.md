Charades is a party game developed in Unity for Android devices (with support for PC versions as well).

## Features

- Play the classic game about guessing a word or thing with help of one or more friends in over 100 different categories: from classics such as Animals to more specific categories, such as characters from a video game.
- Multiple control schemes for mobile devices: Answer using either the gyroscope or your phone's touchscreen (or both)
- Three game modes: Play a quick round in a single category, a selection of rounds in a row, or even mashup many categories in a single chaotic round.
- Built-in 1v1 team mode. Compete head-to-head to see which team gets more points.
- Custom category support, with a built-in creator within the app. You can load and share categories easily.
